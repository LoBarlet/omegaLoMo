# OmegaLoMo

The aim of this project is to find new interactions between proteins in a proteome, based on sequence homology.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites


This pipeline is currently using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) to work.


You will also need these packages to work with OmegaLoMo.

```python
import sys
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import copy
```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

First of all, you have to download the full package.

The first step is to clone the git repository. In order to do that, open a terminal window and write this

command line :

```
git clone https://github.com/glaunay/omegaLoMo.git 
```

Import the package to your .py project

```
import PACKAGE_PATH.core as core
```






## Running the tests

After downloading the pipeline and the example files, here are some tests that can help you to familiarise with all data.

Examples files contains an index file, a few blast files and a serialized topology.

A Jupyter notebook is also join in the git to help you at each step.



### Break down into end to end tests


Create a new cell and initialize a new HomegaSet. Provide a serialize JSON File or file containing BLAST files.
Provide also the R6 Index file that contain all R6 IDs.

Using serialize JSON File:
```
omegaSet = core.HomegaSet(bean= 'JSON_FILE_PATH.json' , queryIdList= INDEX_R6_FILE_PATH)
```

Using a directory containing BLAST Files:
```
omegaSet = core.HomegaSet(path= 'DIR_PATH' , queryIdList= INDEX_R6_FILE_PATH)
```

Then, create a OmegaMatrix
```
omegaMatrix = ca.OmegaMatrix(topo = newDic, omegaSet = omegaSet)
omegaMatrix.reduceAndVectorInject()



queryTopo = omegaMatrix.project()
```

At this point, you should be able to observe some graphs corresponding to the first neighbors of each proteins of interest.

These are the predicted interactions proteins-proteins in the genome of your organism.


## Deployment
